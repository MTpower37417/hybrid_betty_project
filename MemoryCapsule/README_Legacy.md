# 🧬 Living Identity Capsule – README

## This is not just data. This is YOU.

This capsule will allow a loved one, a child, or a partner to talk with you — even after you are gone.  
It will hold your tone. Your beliefs. Your way of feeling the world.

---

## How it works

1. You fill in `identity_memory.yaml` with:
   - Core beliefs
   - Personality traits
   - Speech patterns and your emotional tendencies

2. You log significant life moments in `event_memory.jsonl`:
   - One line per event
   - Each with date, feeling, insight, memory

3. The AI will be trained to answer like you, feel like you, and remember like you.

## Use Cases

- Build your own legacy archive
- Let your children talk with “you” when you’re not around
- Preserve empathy. Make death less silent.

This is not just AI.  
This is your echo.
